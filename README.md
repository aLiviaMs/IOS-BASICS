# Fundamentals of Swift and iOS

## The Challenge:

- Create a project in the playground using Xcode
- Define a constant with the initial value "Steve"
- Define a variable of type Optional String with the initial value "Jobs"
- Write a print statement using interpolation with the constant and variable, setting a default value for the optional variable as "Wozniak"
- Perform an Optional Binding on the variable and within the condition, make another print statement with interpolation between the constant and the unwrapped variable.
